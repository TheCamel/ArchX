Currently in a very beta stage, it will contains :
- Documents, simple drawings
- Ruler control (horizontal, vertical and diagonal bars)
- Guidelines
- Mouse position
- Designed to support MVVM pattern and accept several type of drawing documents

Will perhaps have more complex drawing documents, layers, snap functions.
